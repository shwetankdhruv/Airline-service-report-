Airline Passenger Satisfaction

I am Shwetank Dhruva and this is my report on Airline passenger satisfaction for an airline company “Uni-Global Airlines”. The company provide me with the data of their customer and a survey report about customer satisfaction through this data can say that the total number of customers are 23157 out of which 10,458 customers are not satisfied with the service which is approx. 45.16% of total customers. This is a huge number. We can clearly say that they have to improve the company service. Now about the flight data I found that out of 23157 customers, 82% (18888) customers are loyal customers, and reset 18% (4269) are disloyal customers we can clearly say that the company has a good number of loyal customers which is very impressive.

Area of Improvement –
1.	Food and drink.  :- In this dataset, I found that approx. 42% (9632) gave a rating below 3 in food and drink service. The company must improve its food and drink service.
2.	Departure and Arrival delay. :- Through the flight date I found out that the average delay in the arrival of the flight is 14.44 mins and the average delay in the departure is approx. 14 mins. That is why more than 38% of customers (8944) gave a rating below 3.
3.	Seat Comfort. :- In this dataset, I found that approx. 42% (9783) which gave a rating below 3 in Seat comfort. The company must improve their Seat or replace seats with new comfortable seats.
4.	Gate location. :- In this dataset, I found that more than 36% (8385) felt the gate location are not convenient for them. So the company must provide their customer with a proper map or sign so that customers can easily find the exits and entrances and get their flights on time.


Conclusion :
 If the company improve these problems they must get better result although. This company has a good number of loyal customers the only thing they have to do. To improve their service in these areas.
